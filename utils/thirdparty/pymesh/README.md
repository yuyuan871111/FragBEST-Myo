# Important notice

The wheel file for Python >= 3.6 (< 3.10) can be built by following the README at [PyMesh Github](https://github.com/PyMesh/PyMesh). See the installation guide in the [latest document](http://pymesh.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). 

However, due to outdated dependencies, we use a patched fork of the original **PyMesh** to ensure compatibility with **Python 3.10** (see details: https://github.com/yuyuan871111/PyMesh).
